1,@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
2,"@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!"
3,"@SouthwestAir Is there any way to add a Known Traveler Number to an existing reservation online?  If not, why not?"
4,@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
5,@AmericanAir @USAirways I need to Cancelled Flight a flight I booked earlier tonight. Are you able to do it over Twitter?

21,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
22,"@JetBlue NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We've waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw."
23,@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
24,@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
25,@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
26,@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
27,@SouthwestAir now I'm so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I'm tiny. üòÇüíÅ
28,@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.

30,@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!

37,"@USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help?"
38,@united stellar customer service. You have earned my business by your attention to detail.

41,@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do
42,@SouthwestAir inflight entertainment.  Tonight a Willie Nelson impersonator sang for the passengers #peanutsandtoons http://t.co/kCDdOD7uFF
43,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
44,@JetBlue A month ago I had a flight booked but then had to Cancelled Flight it... I'm now Flight Booking Problems a separate flight for a different occasion.
45,@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold

52,@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
53,@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
54,@SouthwestAir any deals to orlando in April/may??
55,@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
56,@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
57,@SouthwestAir when will the winners of #DestinationDragons be announced?
58,"@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline."
59,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
60,"@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
61,@united that's not even an apology
62,@JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me.
63,@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
64,@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed

66,"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
67,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
68,@USAirways how do you do that? You guys need to have much better communication. How? How can we do that?
69,"@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?"
70,@united sent DM's
71,@USAirways trying to use chairman upgrade cert for flt 740 on 2/26/14 but being told not an option with 10 open seats? How? Thanks
72,@AmericanAir my Mistake multibillion dollar company
73,"@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE"
74,@SouthwestAir How can you get your TSA traveler ID added to your boarding pass? Why would it not be included as TSA precheck? Flying tomorro
75,@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
76,"@USAirways any chance u can help our family rebook their flight that was Cancelled Flightled, #4487?"
77,"@united is hiring - Flight Dispatcher - Chicago, IL (Network Operations Centerl) https://t.co/lio6oCpTEQ"
78,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
79,@AmericanAir I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
80,@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
81,@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
82,"@USAirways What is with your lost &amp; found.  My wife lost her phone in Philly, &amp; followed your web instructions to call an 800#.  No answer."
83,@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
84,@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
85,@USAirways - almost 2 hrs 30 mins on hold - any idea how much longer?
86,"@united Will do, cheers"
87,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
88,@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
89,@AmericanAir not anymore.
90,@AmericanAir 767 seconds from touchdown at Madrid airport in April 2013 #AvGeek http://t.co/1yWXRfn0Gr
91,@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
92,"@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up"
93,"@USAirways Yes, there is horrible snow. But seriously, can you not hire more people to answer the phones? Competitor have call back numbers."
94,@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
95,@SouthwestAir @TifffyHuang I met my twitter friend waiting outside the Troubadour #DestinationDragons http://t.co/lf69waf5ad
96,@SouthwestAir the new logo is going to look amazing on the airplanes
97,@SouthwestAir hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!!
98,@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
99,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
100,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
101,@JetBlue any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
102,@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
103,@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. üòû
104,@JetBlue remember - I'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
105,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
106,@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
107,@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
108,@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
109,"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."
110,@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
111,‚Äú@united: @BattierCCIpuppy We hope to see you on board soon and thanks for the tweet. ^EY‚Äù üëèüëè
112,"@USAirways  flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement üò°"
113,@SouthwestAir so the fares I see for flights in fall are the ABSOULUTELY LOWEST they will be?
114,"@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)"
115,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
116,@USAirways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us

119,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
120,"@JetBlue what can I say, I'm #LostinLove w/our #brandmance https://t.co/Bzwgp7aDVE #wemosaictogether #Mint #Love"
121,@SouthwestAir been on hold for 1.5 hrs. What's up?
122,@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
123,@USAirways Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes.
124,@JetBlue Is it June yet? üòä
125,"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
126,"@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, &amp; picked ""Standby for 1st"" I was not put on the list?"
127,"@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic"
128,@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
129,"@USAirways told me I deserved to be delayed because I booked the last flight and then I hear ""the only inconvience is missing your flight"""
130,@united so what's the solution?
131,"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
132,@JetBlue Challenge accepted. First 5 crew members to send pics in the chairs get FREE tickets to visit us. #wager #IsItSummerYet
133,@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
134,"@SouthwestAir app error - says click here, can't click not hyperlinked http://t.co/IH5w9nfKz2"
135,"@SouthwestAir ""...you in the 10 hrs we were hanging out there? Oh, no I understand things get crazy n sometimes 10 hours isn't long enough."""
136,@JetBlue I was so excited when I saw that you fly there! #ionlyflyblue
137,@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
138,Please don't. RT ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/gdzadXzBYA‚Äù
139,@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
140,@SouthwestAir done
141,@USAirways pilot tells me that all @AmericanAir and US Airways flights across the country have stopped due to a computer system failure.
142,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
143,@AmericanAir my mom‚Äôs flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted w/ no notice. Phone system said callback in 2 hours and it‚Äôs been 4. I need to go to bed!
144,@united already DM you my concern. Pls check.
145,"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
146,"@VirginAmerica classiq, luv Virgin America. Greetingz"
147,@USAirways I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable.
148,"seriously, I want to work on the JetBlue social team RT @JetBlue: @vincenzolandino http://t.co/eiGaJyzcW2"
149,@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
150,@SouthwestAir when will you have flights for October 2015 available?
151,@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
152,@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
153,"@USAirways I left my son's Duke hat on flight #1761 last night. It says ""Mason"" on the back. Any way of locating it? Thanks in advance!"
154,@JetBlue this makes me happy. I hope these aren't empty promises.
155,@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
156,@united @parryaftab done thnx
157,@USAirways been on hold for 39 minutes and counting for a month old change fee refund request for a funeral.  This is pathetic.
158,"@united What does ""Cabin Functionality"" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?"
159,@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
160,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
161,"@JetBlue I'd go to Portsmouth, NH to take care of my friend's son while she takes her daughter to Boston for surgery.  #flyingitforward"
162,@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
163,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
164,".@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover."
165,@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
166,@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
167,"@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after"
168,@united I was. But I have given up.
169,@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
170,@VirginAmerica Just DM'd. Same issue persisting.
171,@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
172,"@United what the...? I go into the ""all airlines lounge"" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted"
173,"@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!"
174,@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
175,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
176,@JetBlue love traveling with Jetblue. Cant wait to go to Paris oui oui!!! NYC was awesomeee!
177,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled two flights from Miami to Nashville yesterday and could not get me on a flight for 3-4 days. #Southwestairwasthere
178,@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
179,@united in fact he received my boarding pass
180,@united that's of course in lax
181,@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
182,"@JetBlue That's right! :) Game, set, match."
183,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
184,@USAirways sad experience today on 4663.  Family on Southwest direct to MCO. My loyalty to USAir = not vacationing with my boys today.
185,@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
186,@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
187,"@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!"
188,@SouthwestAir if you are giving tix to #DestinationDragons show would appreciate one or two for LAüòÑFlying from PHL to LAX on Friday
189,@JetBlue ‚Äôs Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
190,"@SouthwestAir now accepting #Apple's Passbook app for boarding passes. App works on #iPhone &amp; #iPodTouch, not #iPad. http://t.co/XxSaomBdGS"
191,@VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.
192,@USAirways thanks for Cancelled Flighting flight 5097 today. Now missing required training. Not a happy customer.
193,@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
194,@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
195,@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
196,.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
197,@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
198,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
199,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
200,"@JetBlue No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International."
201,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
202,"@VirginAmerica Anytime, sugafly."
203,@JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
204,@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
205,@SouthwestAir trying to get anyone on phone. Flt Cancelled Flighted. Please get me to Denver.
206,@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
207,@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
208,@AmericanAir how do I see your report team?
209,@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
210,@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
211,@JetBlue I just wanted to say flight attendant fitz was the best tonight on flight #1326 bwi/Bos. Great guy and made the flight fantastic!
212,"@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all"
213,@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
214,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
215,"@VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. ""Better seat"" is cabin select not behind the row I selectedüëé #DISAPPOINTED"
216,@JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
217,Hey @united you've upgraded me on a 10 hour International flight. I forgive you :-) thank you!
218,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
219,@VirginAmerica You should still develop an app - then you will be my favorite airline.
220,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
221,@USAirways dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP.
222,"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
223,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
224,"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
225,@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
226,@AmericanAir I'll DM you.
227,@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united

233,@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
234,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
235,@usairways @AmericanAir LAX connect from term 6 to term 4.  55min layover due to delay. US755-AA2595. Is this realistic? Can 2595 be held?
236,@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
237,"@USAirways I'm delayed in TYS #5015, likely gonna miss my connection in CLT to CUN. Gotta get there today. Can you help me?"
238,@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?

253,@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
254,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.

604,@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
605,@SouthwestAir quick question: let's say I book a flight (I did so) and you then drop the price. Do I get the cheaper rate?
606,@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
607,@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you

710,"@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again."
711,"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
712,@USAirways UR employee named VAN @ ticket counter in #Philadelphia. EXTREMELY RUDE! a Father trying to get home to sick kid missed flight.
713,@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
714,".@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now"
715,@JetBlue I would fly somewhere hotter then here. Puerto Rico here I come. Lol

722,"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
723,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
724,@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
725,"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
726,@SouthwestAir @JulGood1 she was traveling with me the one that got miscommunicated with

748,@JetBlue should I expect delays at dca for 7am departure?  Going to Orlando on flight 723
749,@united pls follow for DM.
750,@SouthwestAir just do it that easy
751,@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
752,@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
753,@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
754,@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
755,@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!

759,@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
760,"@USAirways what is wrong in Boston? Why are only your plains not leaving tonight? Son needs to get back to state college, PA"
761,"@AmericanAir I'm flying with your competitor today, starts with an U and ends with D. I will never make that mistake again. #americanforlife"
762,"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
763,"@AmericanAir @GolfWithWoody Don't buy it, Woody. They're making it MUCH worse with understaffing, rudeness, and pre-rookie mistakes"
764,@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
765,"@USAirways after a grt flight to PHX last week,  tonight was terrible. 2.5 hours taxing and you give us water and crackers to compensate."
766,@JetBlue üëç. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
767,@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
768,@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
769,@SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
770,"@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food, good seats, amazing thanks!"
771,@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
772,@AmericanAir what name and department does it come under? Thanks
773,@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling internationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
774,@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling

777,"@SouthwestAir are bicycles that the 62"", 50lbs criteria free or bikes are automatically $75/each way? The FAQ page isn't very clear to me."
778,"@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!"
779,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
780,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
781,"@VirginAmerica hi! I just bked a cool birthday trip with you, but i can't add my elevate no. cause i entered my middle name during Flight Booking Problems üò¢"
782,"@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today."
783,@USAirways 3 hrs on hold. Husband has decided we should sleep in shifts so we don't miss the phone rep. to reschedule
784,@USAirways me too. Me too.
785,@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
786,@JetBlue you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
787,"@SouthwestAir I thank you for the reply but too complicated to DM, really would like to talk to a cust rep. What is going on there?"
788,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
789,"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
790,@USAirways Fuck you
791,@USAirways Please can someone contact me regarding my missing bag? It has been 3 days. Online tracking shows nothing.
792,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
793,@AmericanAir sent
794,@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
795,@USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there

799,@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
800,@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
801,@SouthwestAir Congratulations!
802,@JetBlue look what I capture at Uvf http://t.co/Lj2ZXZN8kG
803,@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
804,@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
805,@SouthwestAir yeah bruh its bool y'all niggaz just need to hire some more workers or something cause next time imma be forced ta disrespect.
806,@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
807,@SouthwestAir i hope i can take my selfie stick on the plane today! #goingtovegas
808,"@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now."
809,@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
810,@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
811,@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
812,@JetBlue Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame.
813,"@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag."
814,@SouthwestAir paid for my own $200 rental car just to not go through this for the 3rd day  :(
815,@USAirways 4 hours on hold to change a Cancelled Flightled flight. Completely unacceptable!!!
816,"@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +"
817,@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
818,@USAirways Yes. Confirmation number and all.
819,"@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks."
820,@SouthwestAir Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk.
821,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
822,@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
823,"@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked."
824,@SouthwestAir your phone service sucks
825,@JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed?
826,@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
827,"@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply."
828,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
829,"@SouthwestAir I ""heart"" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations."
830,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
831,"@united thanks, i made it."
832,@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
833,@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
834,@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
835,@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
836,@JetBlue is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux?
837,@AmericanAir thanks
838,@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
839,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
840,"@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time."
841,"@SouthwestAir been with my GF for 2.5yrs, she's from SF &amp; I live in Tulsa. SWA always takes me there to see my love! #SouthwestLuvSweeps"
842,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
843,@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
844,@AmericanAir I hope you like the photo :) http://t.co/p7fSLuxEGW
845,@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
846,"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
847,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
848,@JetBlue Thank you for your excellent customer service - resolved issue quickly.
849,@SouthwestAir Is there anyway to pay more to get priority boarding A 1-15?
850,"@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time."
851,@USAirways are there such things as non-delayed flights or na? Get your shit together and get me out of here
852,@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
853,@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
854,@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
855,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
856,@USAirways can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time
857,"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
858,"@JetBlue pilot: ""Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane."" Thanks guy"
859,@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
860,"@SouthwestAir - total win!! Happy 7th bday on intercom, chocoLate Flight kisses, and a chance to hand out snacks.Thank you. http://t.co/NKloZcNtto"
861,"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"
862,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
863,@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
864,"@SouthwestAir where are our bags?
We have a tv show to film!!"
865,@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
866,"@united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK"
867,"@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed."
868,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
869,@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel üéâüéâüéâ
870,@AmericanAir it's always nice coming home but I wish you'd fly LAX-MAD and keep me away from Iberia üòú‚úàÔ∏è #GoingForGreat
871,@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
872,@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
873,@united thanks for more timely updates.
874,"@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours."
875,"@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP"
876,@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
877,@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
878,@SouthwestAir has some of the best airfare prices! Gotta LUV them :)
879,"@USAirways 30 min delay for mechanics to replace rivets. 30 mins Late Flightr, turns out mechanics had wrong size rivets. 35 more mins. Pathetic"
880,@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
881,@JetBlue I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it. #skytrax #jetblue #corpgreed #nevertakeno http://t.co/6MBVJFlpBM
882,@JetBlue You definitely will!
883,@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
884,"@AmericanAir @USAirways Yes, obviously! It just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7AM YESTERDAY."
885,@united Flight 280
886,@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled flights and asshole phone support. #worstairline
887,@USAirways Hold time to book award travel from Gold status: 4 HOURS and counting!!!! + 4 days of calling #usairwaysfail @AmericanAir
888,@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
889,@VirginAmerica So excited for my first cross country flight LAX to MCO I've heard nothing but great things about Virgin America. #29DaysToGo
890,‚Äú@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KP‚Äù. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5.
891,@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
892,@SouthwestAir @thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he's not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ?
893,@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
894,"@SouthwestAir Denver to Phoenix, I think we're finally getting ready to take off."
895,@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
896,@SouthwestAir sent
897,"@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?"
898,"@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us."
899,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
900,"@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection"
901,@united sprinted from C concourse to E and just made it. Coughed up a lung in the process but am now in CLT! Tnx!
902,@USAirways Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
903,@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
904,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
905,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
906,@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
907,@americanair line of 100+ people to rebook at MIA now. Virtual hold on rebook line just hangs up during call back. http://t.co/Upaz1eF3Dl
908,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
909,@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
910,@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
911,"@SouthwestAir can't speak with customer service for 2hours, still on hold! Do you guys work?#nogood"
912,@AmericanAir Thanks! He is.
913,"@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised...."
914,@united They held the plane! Made it!!
915,@AmericanAir thank you!
916,"@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?"
917,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
918,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
919,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
920,@SouthwestAir How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.
921,@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
922,@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
923,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
924,@SouthwestAir thank you!!
925,@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
926,@VirginAmerica Thanks for the lovely soft views! #travel #SAN to #SFO http://t.co/CnctL7G1ef
927,@JetBlue walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 http://t.co/p6ucbVlv5E
928,"@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights."
929,@SouthwestAir how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I've earned points but don't see em
930,@VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
931,@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
932,"@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation"
933,@USAirways 3rd connecting flight delayed but still cannot make it &amp; still unable to speak to a real person
934,@USAirways - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A
935,"@USAirways well, depending on the policy will make the determination as to which airline is selected to travel."
936,"@AmericanAir would like to talk to someone, please follow."
937,@AmericanAir *does = doesn't
938,".@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
939,@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
940,@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
941,@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I always tell everyone to fly Southwest! Congratulations!!!
942,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
943,@USAirways I didn't make a reservation yet. It's about changing name on my dividend miles account
944,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
945,"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
946,@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
947,@SouthwestAir I'm running out of money to keep paying for hotel rooms &amp; food in NYC. You don't help people with $ spent
948,@VirginAmerica When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :(
949,@USAirways And the lies continue. Just waited another hr to get boarding passes for flight supposedly created today which is now Cancelled Flightled?!
950,@USAirways - flight was Cancelled Flightled to Buf today. Waited in line for 2+ hrs &amp; cus service was rude. No flight until Tues. Need to get to ROC.

974,@SouthwestAir Any plans to implement a call-back system on your reFlight Booking Problems line? Been on hold for over an hour now...
975,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
976,"@USAirways @AmericanAir 90 min delay thanks to ""maintenance issues"". Thanks for wasting a day."
977,@SouthwestAir This is unbelievable... Thank you so much! #DestinationDragons
978,"@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä

987,"@SouthwestAir thank you, someone finally answered and was able to change my flight that was Cancelled Flighted bc of ice. Thank you for response"
988,@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
989,@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
990,"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability"
991,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
992,@united no wheelchairs
993,@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
994,"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable."
995,@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
996,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
